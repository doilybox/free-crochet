<br><b>1st row - right side:</b> In 2nd ch from hook make sc and hdc group st made; * skip next ch, make a group st in next ch. Repeat from * across to within last 2 ch, skip next ch, draw up a loop in next ch, drop Paddy Green, with Nile Green, yarn over and draw through both loops on hook - color changed in last sc - 60 group sts and 1 sc.
