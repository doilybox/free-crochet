<br><b>2nd row:</b> Shell in sp of first shell, skip next 3 dc of same shell, dc in back loop of next 14 dc, shell in sp of next shell, skip next 3 dc, dc in next ch. The last dc forms end sp to be used for border. Ch 3, turn. Repeat 2nd row for pattern until 90 rows in all have been completed. Break off and fasten.

Join with sl st to tip of first cluster. Turn. 
<br><b>2nd rnd:</b> Sl st loosely in front loop of each st and each ch around. Join. Break off and fasten. Block to measurements. Being careful to keep all strips in one direction, sew strips lengthwise together, leaving the corner clusters free at both ends. 
<br><b>FRINGE:</b> Cut 2 strands of Nile Green, each 12 inches long. Double these strands to form a loop. Insert hook in back loop of the sl st directly over the first corner cluster and draw loop through. Draw loose ends through loop and pull up tightly to form a knot. Knot 2 strands as before in every other sl st along narrow end and in joining between strips. Work fringe along opposite edge in same way. Trim evenly.
