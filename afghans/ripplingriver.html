<br><b>FIRST MOTIF:</b> Starting at center, ch 8. Join with sl st. 
<br><b>1st rnd:</b> Ch 4, 3 tr in ring holding back on hook the last loop of each tr, thread over and draw through all loops on hook, ch 1 to fasten (a 3-tr cluster made), * ch 7, make 4 tr in ring holding back on hook the last loop of each tr, finish cluster. Repeat from * 2 more times; ch 7, sl st in tip of 1st cluster. 
<br><b>2nd rnd:</b> Ch 4, 3-tr cluster in same place as sl st, * ch 3,-5 ,tr in next ch-7 sp, ch 4, 4-tr cluster in tip of next cluster. Repeat from * around. Join last ch-4 to tip of 1st cluster. 
<br><b>3rd rnd:</b> Ch 4, 2-tr cluster in same place as sl st, ch 2, 3-tr cluster in same place, * ch 4, tr in next ch-4 sp, tr in next 5 tr, tr in next sp, ch 4, in tip of next cluster make 3-tr cluster, ch 2 and 3-tr cluster. Repeat from * around. Join last ch-4 to tip of 1st cluster. <br><b>4th rnd:</b> Sl st in ch-2 sp, ch 4, 2-tr cluster in same place as last sl st, in same sp make ( ch 2, 3-tr cluster) twice; * ch 3, 5 tr in next ch-4 sp, ch 3, skip 1 tr, tr in next 5 tr holding back on hook the last loop of each tr, finish as for a cluster; ch 3, 5 tr in next ch-4 sp, ch 3, in next corner sp make three 3 -tr clusters with ch-2 between each cluster. Repeat from * around. Join. 
<br><b>5th rnd:</b> Sl st in next ch-2 sp, ch 4, 2-tr cluster in same place as last sl st, ch 2, 3-tr cluster in same place, * ch 5, in next ch-2 sp make two 3-tr clusters with ch 2 between, ch 3, tr in next sp, tr in next 5 tr, tr in next sp, ch 3, tr in tip of next cluster, ch 3, tr in next sp, tr in next 5 tr, tr in next sp, ch 3, in next ch-2 sp make two 3-tr clusters with ch-2 between. Repeat from * around. Join. 
<br><b>6th rnd:</b> Sl st in next ch-2 sp, ch 4, 2-tr cluster in same place as sl st, ch 2, 3 -tr cluster in same place, * ch 2, in next ch-2 sp make 3-tr cluster, ch 5 and 3-tr cluster; ch 2, in next ch-2 sp make two 3-tr clusters with ch-2 between, ch 5, skip 1 tr, tr in next 5 tr holding the last loop of each tr on hook, finish as for a cluster; ch 8, skip 1 tr, and ch 3, sc in next tr, ch 8, skip ch-3 and 1 tr, 5-tr cluster over next 5 tr, ch 5, in next ch-2 sp make two 3-tr clusters with ch-2 between. Repeat from * around. Join. Fasten off. 
<br><b>SECOND MOTIF:</b> Work first 5 rnds as for First Motif. 
<br><b>6th rnd:</b> Sl st in next ch-2 sp, ch 4, 2-tr cluster in same place as sl st, ch 2, 3-tr cluster in same place, ch 2, 3-tr cluster in next sp, ch 2, sl st in corresponding sp of First Motif, ch 2, 3 -tr cluster back in same place as last cluster on Second Motif, ch 2, in next ch-2 sp make two 3-tr clusters with ch-2 between, ch 5, skip 1 tr, 5 -tr cluster over next 5 tr, ch 4, sl st in corre-sponding sp on First Motif, ch 4, skip next tr and ch 4, sc back in next tr on Second Motif. Join the next loop in the same way. Continue as for 6th rnd of First Motif, joining next corner to First Motif as previous corner was joined. Complete rnd as for First Motif. Make necessary number of motifs, joining adjacent sides as Second Motif was joined to First ( whenever 4 corners meet, join 3rd and 4th corners to joining of other corners). 
<br><b>EDGING: 1st rnd:</b> Attach thread to tip of 1st cluster on corner motif following a joining, ch 8, tr in tip of next cluster, (ch 4, tr in tip of next cluster) twice, ( ch 4, tr in next sp) twice, ( ch 4, tr in tip of next cluster) 4 times; ch 4, in center st of corner sp make tr, ch 5 and tr; * ( ch 4, tr in tip of next cluster) 4 times, ( ch 4, tr in next sp) twice, ( ch 4, tr in next cluster) 4 times; ch 4, tr in joining.
