<br><b>2nd rnd:</b> Ch 3, dc in same place as sl st, (ch 2, skip 1 dc, 2 dc in next dc) 11 times; ch 2, sl st in top of ch-3.
<br><b>3rd rnd:</b> Sl st in next dc and in next sp, ch 3, in same sp make dc, ch 2 and 2 dc (a starting shell). In each sp around make 2 dc, ch 2 and 2 dc (shell). Join.
<br><b>4th rnd:</b> Sl st in next dc and in next sp, ch 3 and make a starting shell in same sp, (ch 2, shell over next shell) 11 times; ch 2. Join.
<br><b>5th rnd:</b> Sl st in next dc and in next sp, ch 3 and make a starting shell over this starting shell, (ch 4, in sp of next shell make 2 dc, ch 5 and 2 dc; ch 4, shell over next shell) 5 times; ch 4, in next shell make 2 dc, ch 5 and 2 dc; ch 4. Join.
<br><b>6th rnd:</b> Sl st in next dc and in next sp, * shell over shell, ch 3, 13 tr in next ch-5 loop, ch 3. Repeat from * around. Join.
<br><b>7th rnd:</b> Sl st in next dc and in next sp, * shell over shell, ch 3, (tr in next tr, ch 1) 12 times; tr in next tr, ch 3. Repeat from * around. Join.
<br><b>8th rnd:</b> Sl st in next dc and in next sp, * shell over shell, (ch 3, sc in next ch-1 sp) 12 times; ch 3. Repeat from * once more. In sp of next shell make (2 dc, ch 2) twice and 2 dc. ** (Ch 3, sc in next ch-1 sp) 12 times; ch 3, shell over shell. Repeat from ** 2 more times. Ch 2, 2 dc in same place as last shell, (ch 3, sc in next ch-1 sp) 12 times; ch 3. Join.
<br><b>9th rnd:</b> Sl st in next dc and in next sp, * shell over shell, ch 3, skip ch-3, sc in next loop, (ch 3, sc in next loop) 10 times; ch 3. Repeat from * once more; (shell in next ch-2 sp, ch 2) twice; ch 1 more, skip ch-3, sc in next loop. Work over remainder of rnd to correspond.
<br><b>10th rnd:</b> Sl st in next dc and in next sp, * shell over shell, ch 3, skip ch-3, (sc in next loop, ch 3) 9 times; sc in next loop, ch 3. Repeat from * once more. Shell over shell, ch 2, shell in sp between shells, ch 2, shell over shell. Work over remainder of rnd to correspond, making an increase, as before, directly opposite other increase.
<br><b>11th rnd:</b> Sl st in next dc and in next sp, * shell over shell, ch 3, skip ch-3, sc in next loop, (ch 3, sc in next loop) 8 times; ch 3. Repeat from * once more. Shell over shell, (ch 3, shell over shell) twice; ch 3 and work over remainder of rnd to correspond.
<br><b>12th rnd:</b> Shell over shell, * ch 3, skip next ch 3, sc in next loop, (ch 3, sc in next loop) 7 times; ch 3, in sp of next shell make (2 dc, ch 2) twice and 2 dc; ch 3, skip ch-3, sc in next loop, (ch 3, sc in next loop) 7 times; ch 3, shell over shell, ch 4, in sp of next shell make 2 dc, ch 5, and 2 dc; ch 4, shell over shell, ch 3, skip next ch 3, sc in next loop, (ch 3, sc in next loop) 7 times; ch 3, in sp of next shell make (2 dc, ch 2) twice and 2 dc. Repeat from * once more, but ending with 2 dc in same place as 1st shell, ch 2. Join.

<br><b>2nd row:</b> Shell over shell, ch 3, make 5 loops across pineapple, ch 3, shell over shell. Ch 4, turn. Repeat the 2nd row, making 1 loop less on each row until 1 loop remains. Ch 4, turn.
