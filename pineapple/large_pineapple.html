<font face="verdana" size="2"><b>MATERIALS:</b><br> 

<br><b>1st Round:</b> Ch 6, join to form a ring, ch 1 and work 8 sc in ring, join in 1st sc. 
<br><b>2nd Round:</b> * Ch 10, sc in next sc, repeat from * 6 times, ch 4, dtrc (3 times over hook) in same space as 
beginning (this brings thread in position for next round) . 
<br><b>3rd Round:</b> Ch 3, 2 dc in same space, * ch 7, 3 dc in next loop, repeat from * all around, ch 7, join. 
<br><b>4th Round:</B> Sl st in next dc, ch 1, sc in same space, * ch 5, 1 dc, ch 3, 1 dc in center st of next loop, ch 5, sc in center dc of next dc group, repeat from * all around ending to correspond, join. 
<br><b>5th Round:</b> Sl st into 2nd loop, ch 3 (counts as part of 1st cluster st), dc in same space, ch 5, 2 dc cluster 
st in same space (2 dc cluster st: 2 dc in same space keeping last loop of each dc on hook, thread over and work 
off all loops at one time), repeat from * twice, * ch 5, skip 2 loops, 4 - 2 dc cluster sts with ch 5 between each 
cluster st in next loop, repeat from * all around, ch 5, join. 
<br><b>6th Round:</b> Sl st to center of loop, * ch 5, sc in next loop, ch 5, sc in next loop, ch 5, 3 dc in center st of 
next loop, ch 5, sc in next loop, repeat from * all around, join.

in next loop, ch 7, skip 1 loop, 2 - 2 dc cluster sts with ch 4 between in next loop (cluster st shell), repeat from *

remainder of doily.
