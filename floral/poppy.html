<font face="verdana" size="2"><b>MATERIALS:</b>
To make this doily you will need a size 8 steel crochet hook and four balls of number 30 crochet cotton in white, red or orange, green and black. Measures about 8 inches in diameter. <br><b>Abbreviations:</b> Rnd (round); ch (chain); dc (double crochet); sc (single crochet); inc (increase); tr (treble)—thread over 3 times and work off 2 loops at a time; lp (loop); sl st (slip stitch); hdc (half double crochet) —thread over once, insert hook in st and pull lp through, thread over and work off all lps at one time. 
<br><b>Center:</b> In white ch 10, join with sl st to form ring. 
<br><b>Rnd 1:</b> Ch 3 (counts as a dc) , 29 dc in ring, join with a sl st in top of ch 3. 
<br><b>Rnd 2:</b> Ch 4, * dc in next dc, ch 1, repeat from * around, sl st in third st of beginning ch. 
<br><b>Rnds 3 through 5:</b> Work in same manner as for rnd 2, inc beginning ch one st each rnd. The ch between each dc should be increased one st in each rnd. There are 4 ch sts between each dc in rnd 5. 
<br><b>Rnd 6:</b> * Ch 6, sc in next dc, repeat from * 28 times, for the last (30th) lp ch 3, dc at base of first ch 6. This brings you in position to start next rnd. 
<br><b>Rnd 7:</b> * Ch 6, sc in next ch 6, repeat from * 28 times, the last lp is a ch of 3 and dc at base of first ch 6. You are now ready to start the next rnd. 
<br><b>Rnds 8 and 9:</b> Repeat rnd 7. 
<br><b>Rnds 10 and 11:</b> * Ch 7, sc in next lp, repeat from * 28 times, end with ch 3, tr at base of first ch. 
<br><b>Rnd 12:</b> * Ch 8, sc in next lp, repeat from * 28 times, end with ch 4, tr at base of first ch. 
<br><b>Rnd 13:</b> Sl st to center of first lp in previous rnd, (ch 3 for a dc, 2 dc, ch 3, 3 dc—a shell made) in same lp, ch 4, sc in next lp, ch 8, sc in next lp, ch 4, a shell in next lp, ch 4, sc in next lp, ch 8, sc in next lp, ch 4, repeat from * around, end with sl st in first ch 3. Fasten off. 
<br><b>Poppy: Center:</b> In black, ch 6, sl st in first ch to form ring, ch 3, make 14 dc into ring, sl st in ch 3. Fasten off. 
<br><b>Petals:</b> Rnd 1: In red or orange, join to black center, ch 3, dc at base of ch 3, 2 dc in each of the remaining dc, sl st in top of ch 3. 
<br><b>Rnd 2:</b> * Sc in each of next 3 dc, hdc and dc in next dc, 2 dc in next dc, dc and hdc in next dc. Repeat from * around, sl st in st at base of hdc. This forms 5 petals. 
<br><b>Rnd 3:</b> * Sc in each of 3 sc, hdc and dc in next dc, 2 dc in each of 4 dcs, dc and hdc in next dc, repeat from 8 around, sl st at base of hdc. 
<br><b>Rnd 4:</b> * Sc in each of next 3 sc, hdc and dc in next dc, 2 dc in each of next 10 dcs, dc and hdc in next dc, repeat from * around, sl st in first sc. Fasten off. 
<br><b>Rnd 5:</b> Join green thread near center of any petal, ch 4, sc in next st, ch 1, sc to ch of a shell on center, ch 1, sc in next st on petal, * ch 4, sc in next st, repeat from * around, sl st at base of first ch 4.
