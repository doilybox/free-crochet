 J. & P. COATS "BIG BALL" BEST SIX CORD MERCERIZED CROCHET, Art. A. 104, Size 30: 1 ball each of No. 1 White and No. 15-A Shaded Dk. Pinks; or CLARK'S "BIG BALL" MERCERIZED CROCHET, Art. B. 34, Size 30: 1 ball each of No. 1 White and No. 15-A Shaded Dk. Pinks. <br>Milwards Steel Crochet Hook No. 10. 
<br>Doily measures 12 inches in diameter.
<br>Starting at center with White, ch 9. Join with sl st to form ring. 
<br><b>1st rnd:</b> 16 sc in ring. Join to first sc. 
<br><b>NOTE:</b> Hereafter do not join rnds unless otherwise stated. 
<br><b>2nd rnd:</b> Ch 1, sc in joining, * ch 5, skip 1 sc, sc in next sc. Repeat from * around, ending with ch 5. 
<br><b>3rd rnd:</b> * Sc in next sc, 2 sc in next sp, ch 4. Repeat from * around. 
<br><b>4th to 15th rnds incl:</b> * Skip first sc, sc in each remaining sc of sc group, 2 sc in sp, ch 4. Repeat from * around. 
<br>15 sc in each sc group on last rnd. 
<br><b>16th rnd:</b> * Skip 1 sc, sc in next 13 sc, ch 5, sc in sp, ch 5. Repeat from * round. 
<br><b>17th rnd:</b> * Skip 1 sc, sc in next 11 sc, (ch 5, sc in next ch-5 loop) twice; ch 5. Repeat from * around. Continue in this manner, having 2 sc less in each sc group and 1 loop more between sc groups on each rnd, until 1 sc remains in each sc group. End last rnd with ch 2, dc in first sc to form last loop. <br>64 loops.<br> Now work as follows : 
<br><b>1st rnd:</b> Ch 1, sc in loop just formed, * ch 2, sc in next loop, (ch 5, sc in next loop) 7 times. Repeat from * around, ending with ch 2, dc in first sc to form last loop. 
<br><b>2nd rnd:</b> Ch 1, sc in loop just formed, * ch 5, skip next ch-2 sp, sc in next loop, (ch 5, sc in next loop) 6 times. Repeat from * around, ending as on first rnd. 
<br><b>3rd rnd:</b> Ch 1, sc in loop, * ch 5, sc in next loop. Repeat from * around, ending as before.<br>56 loops. 
<br><b>4th rnd:</b> Ch 1, sc in loop, * ch 3, 7 dc in next loop, ch 3, sc in next loop, (ch 5, sc in next loop) 5 times. Repeat from * around, ending as before. 
<br><b>5th rnd:</b> Ch 1, sc in loop, * ch 5, skip next ch-3 sp, sc in next dc, ch 5, skip next 5 dc, sc in next dc, (ch 5, sc in next ch-5 loop) 5 times; ch 5, sc in next dc, ch 5, skip next 5 dc, sc in next dc, (ch 5, sc in next ch-5 loop) twice; ch 5, in next loop make sc, ch 5 and sc; (ch 5, sc in next loop) twice. Repeat from * around, ending as before. <br>60 loops. 
<br><b>6th rnd:</b> Ch 1, sc in loop, * ch 7, sc in next loop. Repeat from * around. Join. Break off and fasten. 
<br><b>FIRST ROSETTE:</b> With Pinks ch 10. Join with sl st to form ring. 
<br><b>1st rnd:</b> 24 sc in ring. Join to first sc. 
<br><b>2nd rnd:</b> Ch 1, sc in joining, (ch 5, skip 3 sc, sc in next sc) 5 times; ch 5. Join to first sc<br>6 loops. 
<br><b>3rd rnd:</b> In each loop around make sc, hdc, 3 dc, hdc and sc. Join.<br>6 petals. 
<br><b>4th rnd:</b> (Ch 5, sc in back loop of next sc on 2nd rnd between next 2 petals) 5 times; ch 5. Join.<br>6 loops. 
<br><b>5th rnd:</b> In each loop around make sc, ch 2, 7 dc, ch 2 and sc. Join. 
<br><b>6th rnd:</b> Sl st in net ch, sc in next ch, * ch 5, skip 3 dc, sc in next dc, ch 5, sc in first ch of next ch-2, ch 5, sc in 2nd ch of next ch-2. Repeat from * around, ending with ch 2, dc in first sc to form last loop. 
<br><b>7th rnd:</b> Ch 1, sc in loop just formed, * ch 6, sc in next loop. Repeat from * around, ending with ch 3, dc in first sc. Join. <br><b>8th rnd:</b> Ch 1, sc in loop, ch 6, sc in any loop on last rnd of doily, ch 2, sl st in 3rd ch of ch-6, ch 3, sc in next loop on rosette, (ch 6, sc in next loop on doily, ch 2, sl st in 3rd ch of ch-6, ch 3, sc in next loop on rosette) 5 times; * ch 8, sl st in 5th ch from hook. Picot made; ch 3, sc in next loop on rosette. Picot loop made. Repeat from * around. Join. <br>Break off and fasten.
