<br><b>2nd Rnd:</b> Ch 1 and work 4 sc over each loop, join.
<br><b>3rd Rnd:</b> Ch 8, dc in same space, skip 4 sc, * 1 dc, ch 5, 1 dc in space over next cluster st of previous row, repeat from * all around, join in 3rd st of ch.
<br><b>4th Rnd:</b> Ch 1 and * work 6 sc over next loop, sc in center of next 2 dc, repeat from * all around, join.
<br><b>5th Rnd:</b> Sl st in each of the next 2 sc, ch 18, sc in 2nd st from hook and work 19 sc over balance of ch, 1 sl st in each of the next 2 sc of circle, ** ch 1, turn and working in back loop of st only for entire scroll, 1 sc in each of the next 19 sc on scroll, ch 3, turn, 1 sc in 3rd ch from hook, 1 sc in each of the next 5 sc, * ch 1, turn, 1 sc in each of the next 4 sc, ch 3, turn, 1 sc in 3rdch from hook, 1 sc in each of the next 4 sc, 1 sc in each of the next 2 sc on side of scroll, repeat from * 6 times, 1 sl st in each of the next 5 sc of circle working through both loops, ch 17, turn, sl st in 3rd picot from bottom of scroll just completed, ch 1, turn and work 20 sc over ch, 1 sl st in each of the next 2 sc of circle working through both loops, repeat from ** until 7 scrolls have been completed.
