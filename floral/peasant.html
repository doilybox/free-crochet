<font face="verdana" size="2"><b>MATERIALS:</b>
 
 Number 30 crochet cotton and number 12 steel crochet hook. You will need about 675 yards of thread. Doily measures about 28 1/2 inches in diameter. 
<br><b>Abbreviations:</b> ch (chain) tr (treble) st (stitch) dtr (double treble) sl st (slip stitch) sk (skip) sc (single crochet) lp (loop) dc (double crochet) rnd (round).

<br><b> Circle of Wheels:</b> This circle is completed first in order to have it ready for joining when working rnd 18 of doily center. 
<br><b>Rnd 1:</b> Ch 8, sl st to form a ring. Ch 3, (dc in ring) 23 times. Counting the ch 3 as 1 dc there are 24 dc in ring. sl st in top of ch 3. 
<br><b>Rnd 2:</b> Ch 6, dc in second dc of previous rnd, * ch 3, sk 1 dc, dc next, repeat from * around, end with ch 3, sl st in third st of ch 6. There will be 12 spokes and 12 spaces. 
<br><b>Rnd 3:</b> Ch 8, * dc in next dc, ch 5, repeat from * around, end with sl st in third st of ch 8. 
<br><b>Rnd 4:</b> Ch 5, 4 dtr at base of ch (to make a dtr: thread over hook 3 times and work off 2 lps at a time), * ch 3, 5 dtr in next dc, repeat from * around, end with eh 3, sl st in top of ch 5. 
<br><b>Rnd 5:</b> Ch 4, tr at base of ch (to make a tr: thread over twice and work off 2 lps at a time), tr in each of next 3 dtr, 2 tr in next dtr, * ch 4, 2 tr in first dtr of next group, dtr in each of next 3 dtr, 2 tr in last dtr, repeat from * around, end with ch 4, sl st in top of first ch 4.

This completes the first wheel. Make a second wheel, joining the first and second spokes to any two spokes of first wheel. Join the third wheel and every remaining wheel by joining the first and second spokes to the 8th and 9th spokes of previous wheel. The 14th wheel should also be joined to the 8th and 9th spokes of first wheel to close the circle. There are 14 wheels in the 
circle.
