<br><br><b>1st rnd:</b> Starting at center, ch 9. Join with sl st to form ring. 16 sc in ring, sl st in first sc made. 
<br><b>2nd rnd:</b> Sc in same place as sl st, * ch 5, skip 1 sc, sc in next sc. Repeat from * around, ending With ch 5, sl st in first sc. 
<br><b>3rd rnd:</b> Sc in same place as sl st, * 2 sc in ch-5 sp, ch 4, sc in next sc. Repeat from * around, ending with sl st in first sc. 
<br><b>4th to 15th rds incl:</b> *Sc in next sc and in each remaining sc of sc group, 2 sc in ch-4 sp, ch 4, skip first sc of next sc group. Repeat from * around (15 sc in each sc group on last rd). Join as before. 
<br><b>16th rnd:</b> * Sc in next 13 sc, ch 4, sc in ch-1 sp, ch 4, skip next sc. Repeat from * around. Join. 
<br><b>17th rnd:</b> * Sc in next 11 sc, (ch 5, sc in next loop) twice: ch 5, skip next sc. Repeat from * around. Join. Continue in this manner. having 2 sc less in each sc group and 1 loop more between sc groups on each rnd until 1 sc remains in each sc group, ending with ch 2, dc in first sc. 
<br>Now work as follows: 
<br><b>1st rnd:</b> * Ch 2, sc in next loop. (ch 5, sc in next loop) 7 times. Repeat from * around, ending with ch 2, dc in dc. 
<br><b>2nd rnd:</b> * Ch 3, skip ch-2 loop, sc in next loop, (ch 5, sc in next loop) 6 times. Repeat from * around, ending as previous rnd.

<br><b>6th rnd:</b> (Ch 5, sc in next loop) twice; * ch 3, sc between 3rd and 4th dc of dc group, (ch 5, sc in next loop) 7 times. Repeat from * around. join. 
<br><b>7th rnd:</b> * Ch 5, sc in next loop. Repeat from * around, increasing 1 loop evenly around * inc 1 loop, make (sc, ch 5) twice in same loop. join and break off (65 loops). 
<br><b>FIRST ROSETTE:</b>  
<br><b>1st rnd:</b> Ch 10, join. 24 sc in ring: join. 
<br><b>2nd rnd:</b> Ch 5, skip 3 sc. Sc in next sc. Repeat from * around (6 loops). Join. 
<br><b>3rd rnd:</b> In each loop around make sc, hdc, 3 dc, hdc and sc, join. 
<br><b>4th rnd:</b> * Ch 5, sc in back loop of sc between this and next petal. Repeat from * around (6 loops). Join. 
<br><b>5th rnd:</b> In each loop around make sc, ch 2, 7 dc, ch 2 and sc; join. 
<br><b>6th rnd:</b> Sl st in each of next 2 ch, sc in same place as last sl st, * ch 5, skip 3 dc, sc next dc, ch 5, sc in first ch of next ch-2, ch 5, sc in 2nd ch of next ch-2. Repeat from * around. join to first sc. 
<br><b>7th rnd:</b> Sl st to center of first loop, sc in same loop, * ch 6, sc in next loop. Repeat from * around. Join. 
<br><b>8th rnd:</b> Sl st to center of first loop, sc in same loop, ch 7, sc in next loop, * ch 3, sc in center of one loop on last rnd of center, ch 3, sc in next loop on rosette. Repeat from * 5 more times (6 loops joined). Make a ch-7 loop in all remaining loops of Rosette, join. Break off. 
<br><b>SECOND ROSETTE</b> Work as for First Rosette until 7 rnds have been completed. 
<br><b>8th rnd:</b> Sl st to center of first loop, sc in same loop. then join to First Rosette as follows: Ch 3, sc in 2nd free loop after last joining on First Rosette, ch 3, sc in next loop on Second Rosette, ch 3, sc in next loop on First Rosette, ch sc in next loop on Second Rosette, ch 3, sc in same place as the last joining of First Rosette to center, ch 3, sc in next loop on Second Rosette, join next 5 loops of Second Rosette to next 5 loops on center in same way as First Rosette was joined. Make a ch-7 loop in all remaining loops of rosette, join (10 free loops). Make 11 more rosettes, joining them in same way and taking care to join the last rosette on both sides. Now work in rnds as follows: 
<br><b>1st rnd:</b> Attach thread to first free loop on any motif, ch 9, * (sc in next loop, ch 6) 6 times; dc in next 2 loops. ch 6. Repeat from * around. Join to 3rd ch of ch-9.

<br><b>5th rnd:</b> Sl st to center of next loop, sc in same loop, * ch 7, sc in next loop. Repeat from * around. join. 
<br><b>6th rnd:</b> Increase 5 loops evenly around, join and break off. 
<br><b>FIRST PINWHEEL MOTIF</b><br>Work as for center of doily until there are 7 sc on each group.

<br><b>9th rnd:</b> Sc in next 3 sc. * (ch 5, sc in next loop) twice: ch 5, skip 1 sc. sc in next 3 sc. Repeat from * around. join. 
<br><b>10th rnd:</b> Sc in next  sc * (ch 5, sc in next loop) 3 times; ch 5, skip 1 sc. Sc in next sc. Repeat from * around, ending with ch 2. dc in first Sc. To Join Motif to Center: 
<br><b>11th rnd:</b> Ch 3, sl st in any loop on center, ch 3, sc in next loop on motif, (ch sl st in next loop on center, ch 3, sc in next loop on motif) twice; * ch 7, sc in next loop. Repeat from * around. Join. 
<br><b>SECOND PINWHEEL MOTIF:</b><br>Work as for First Pinwheel Motif until 10 rnds have been completed. 
<br><b>11th rnd:</b> Ch 3, sl st in 6th free loop on First Pinwheel Motif, ch 3, sc in next loop on Second pinwheel Motif, (ch 3, sl st in next loop on First Pinwheel Motif, ch 3, sc in next loop on Second Pinwheel Motif) twice; (ch 7, sc in next loop) 3 times; skip 2 loops on center, join next 3 loops on motif to center as before. Complete rnd as for First Pinwheel Motif. Make 14 more motifs, joining to preceding motif and to center as before. Join last motif to first motif. 
<br><b>FILL-IN-MOTIF:</b><br>Attach thread to first free loop on center, ch 4, tr in same loop, holding back on hook the last loop of each tr, make 2 tr in next loop, thread over and draw through all loops on hook (cluster made), make a cluster in each free loop on motif. Join and break off. Fill in all sps the same way. 
<br><b>EDGING:<br>1st rnd:</b> Attach thread to 3rd free loop on any motif, sc in Same place, * (ch 7, sc in next loop) 12 times; ch 3, dc in next loop, tr in next 2 loops, dc in next loop, ch 3, sc in next loop. Repeat from * around. Join. 
<br><b>2nd rnd:</b> Sl st to center of next loop, ch 4, tr in next loop. * (ch 7, sc in next loop) 8 times: ch 7, holding back on hook the last loop of each tr make tr in next 4 loops, thread over and draw through all loops on hook (joint cluster made). Repeat from * around, ending with a 2-tr cluster. Join to top of first tr. 
<br><b>3rd rnd:</b> 5 sc in next loop, * (ch 7, sc in next loop) 7 times: ch 7, 5 sc in each of next 2 loops. Repeat from * around. join. 
<br><b>4th rnd:</b> Sc in first 5 sc, * 5 sc in next loop. (ch 10, sc in next loop) 6 times; ch 10, 5 sc in next loop. Sc in next 10 sc. Repeat from * around. join. 
<br><b>5th rnd:</b> Sc in same place as sl st, * ch 3, in each of next 7 loops make 6 sc, ch 3, sc in 3rd ch front hook (picot made) and 6 sc: ch 3, sc in center of next sc group. Repeat from * around. Join and break off. Starch lightly and press.
