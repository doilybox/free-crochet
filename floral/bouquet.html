<font face="verdana" size="2"><b>MATERIALS:</b>
Today most crocheters use the newer crochet thread. I would suggest you use what you have or what you can find. I use crochet cotton #10 on almost all my doilies. I usually use southmaid or Aunt Lydia's. There are many different brands. It will make about 14 inch doily with #10. crochet cotton and a size 11 hook.
