COATS KNIT-CRO-SHEEN, 45 balls of White or Ecru, or 54 balls of any color for single size spread; 57 halls of White or Ecru, or 68 bails of any color for double size spread. 
<br>MILWARD'S steel crochet hook No. 5 or 6. GAUGE: Each block measures 61/4 inches square. For a <b>single size</b> spread, about 72 x 108 inches, make 11 x "1.7 blocks. For a <b>double size</b> spread, about 92 x 108 inches, make 14 x 17 blocks. 
<br><b>BLOCK:</b> Ch 8, join with sl st. 
<br><b>1st rnd:</b> Ch 6, *dc in ring, ch 3. Repeat from* 4 more times: Join to 3rd st of ch-6 (6 sps). 
<br><b>2nd rnd:</b> In each sp make sc, half dc, 2 dc, half dc and sc (6 petals). 
<br><b>3rd rnd:</b> * Ch 4, sc in dc of 1st rnd (between petals). Repeat from * around. Ch 4, join. <br><b>4th rnd:</b> In each loop make sc, half dc, 3 dc, half dc and sc. 
<br><b>5th rnd:</b> * Ch 5, sc in back loop of sc of 3rd rnd. Repeat from * around. 
<br><b>6th rnd:</b> Same as 4th rnd, making 4 dc instead of 3 dc. 
<br><b>7th rnd:</b> Same as 5th rnd, making ch-6 loops. 
<br><b>8th rnd:</b> Same as 4th rnd, making 6 dc instead of 3 dc. 
<br><b>9th rnd:</b> * Ch 3, sc between 3rd and 4th dc at back of next petal, ch 3, sc in back loop of next sc. Repeat from * around. Sl st in 1st ch-3 loop. <br><b>10th rnd:</b> Ch 3, 3 dc in same place as sl st, * ch 2, 4 dc in next sp. Repeat from* around; join. 
<br><b>11th rnd:</b> Sl st in next 3 dc, sl st in sp, ch 3, dc in same sp* (ch 5, sc in 4th ch from hook, thus making a p (picot)) 3 times; sc in ch between 1st 2 p's, p, ch 1, sc in ch between 1st p and last dc, 2 dc in same sp as last dc, ch 3, 2 dc in next ch-2 sp. Repeat from * around, ending with 2 dc in same place as last dc, ch 3, sl st in 3rd st of ch-3 first made. Fasten off. 
<br><b>12th rnd:</b> Attach thread between 2nd and 3rd p's of 1st p-loop, * ch 11, sc between 2nd and 3rd p's of next p-loop. Repeat from * around. 
<br><b>13th rnd:</b> Sc in each ch and in each sc around. Ch 1, turn. <br>Work is now done in rows instead of rnds, picking up only the back loop of each sc. 
<br><b>1st row:</b> Sl st in 1st sc, sc in next 35 sc. Ch 2, turn. 
<br><b>2nd row:</b> Skip 2 sc, sc in next 15 sc, pc st in next sc-to make a pc st, ch 1, make 5 dc in st, remove hook, insert hook back in ch-1 and draw dropped loop through, ch 1 to fasten. Sc in next 15 sc. Ch 2, turn. 
<br><b>3rd row:</b> Skip 2 sc, sc in each st across. Ch 2, turn. 
<br><b>4th row:</b> Skip 2 sc, sc in next 11 sc, pc st in next sc, sc in next 3 sc, pc st in next sc, sc in next 11 sc. Ch 2, turn. 
<br><b>5th row:</b> Same as 3rd row. 
<br><b>6th row:</b> Skip 3 sc, sc in next 6 sc, pc st in next sc; (sc in next 3 sc, pc st in next sc) twice; sc in next 7 sc. Ch 2, turn. 
<br><b>7th row:</b> Same as 3rd row, but skip 3 sc (instead of 2 sc). 
<br><b>8th row:</b> Skip 3 sc, sc in next 5 sc, pc st in next st, sc in next 3 sc, pc st in next sc, sc in next 6 sc. Ch 2, turn.
