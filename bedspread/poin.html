<br><b>1st rnd:</b> 6 sc in 2nd ch from hook. Do not join rnd. 
<br><b>2nd rnd:</b> 2 sc in each sc around. 
<br><b>3rd rnd:</b> Repeat 2nd rnd, then join with sl st to first sc (24 sc). 
<br><b>4th rnd:</b> Ch 3 - to count as 1 dc, 2 dc in joining, (ch 1, skip next sc, 3 dc in next sc) 11 times; ch 1. Join to top of ch-3 (12 petals started). <br><b>5th rnd:</b> Ch 3, dc in next 2 dc, (ch 1, dc in next 3 dc) 11 times; ch 1. Join as before. 
<br><b>6th rnd:</b> Ch 3, 3 dc in next dc, dc in next dc, (ch 1, dc in next dc, 3 dc in next dc, dc in next dc) 11 times; ch 1. Join. 
<br><b>7th rnd:</b> Ch 3, * making 3 dc in center dc, dc in each dc across petal, ch 1. Repeat from * around. Join. 
<br><b>8th rnd:</b> Ch 3, * dc in each dc across petal, ch 1. Repeat from * around. Join. 
<br><b>9th & 10th rnds:</b> Repeat 7th and 8th rnds. 
<br><b>11th rnd:</b> Ch 3, * (dc in each dc across petal, ch 2) twice; dc in each dc across next petal, ch 5, dtr in next sp, ch 5 (corner). Repeat from * around. Join. 
<br><b>12th rnd:</b> Ch 3, * (making a cluster over center 3 dc, dc in each dc across petal, ch 2, dc in next sp, ch 2) twice; to make a cluster work as follows: holding back on hook the last loop of each dc, dc in 3 dc, thread over and draw through all loops on hook; making a cluster over center 3 dc, dc in each dc across petal, ch 4, in corner dtr make 3 dtr, ch 3 and 3 dtr, ch 4. Repeat from * around. Join. 
<br><b>13th rnd:</b> Ch 3, * (making a cluster over center 3 sts, dc in each dc across petal, ch 3, sc in next dc, ch 3) twice; making a cluster over center 3 sts, dc in each dc across petal, ch 4, (sc in next 3 dtr, ch 3, sc in next loop, ch 3, sc in next 3 dtr, ch 4. Repeat from * around. Join. 
<br><b>14th rnd:</b> Ch 3, * (making a cluster over center 3 sts, dc in each dc across petal, ch 5, sc in next sc, ch 5) twice; making a cluster over center 3 sts, dc in each dc across next petal; ch 5, dtr in next 3 sc, ch 3, in next sc make 3 dtr, ch 3 and 3 dtr; ch 3, dtr in next 3 sc, ch 5. Repeat from * around. Join. <br><b>15th rnd:</b> Ch 3, cluster over next 2 sts, * (ch 7, sc in next sc, ch 7, skip next sp, cluster over next 3 sts) twice; (ch 5, sc in next 3 dtr) twice; ch 3, in corner loop make sc, ch 5 and sc; ch 3, (sc in next 3 dtr, ch 5) twice; skip next sp, cluster over next 3 sts. Repeat from * around. Join to tip of first cluster. Break off and fasten. 
<br><b>SECOND MOTIF:</b> Work exactly as for First Motif until 14 rnds have been completed. 
<br><b>15th rnd:</b> Ch 3, cluster over next 2 sts, (ch 7, sc in next sc, ch 7, skip next sp, cluster over next 3 sts) twice; (ch 5, sc in next 3 dtr) twice; ch 3, sc in next corner loop, ch 2, now join 2 motifs along one side as follows: Sl st in any corner loop on First Motif; ch 2, sc in same corner loop on Second Motif; ch 3, sc in next 3 dtr on Second Motif; ch 2, sl st in next ch-5 loop on First Motif; ch 2, sc in next 3 dtr on Second Motif; ch 2, si st in next loop on First Motif; ch 2, skip next sp on Second Motif; cluster over next 3 sts on Second Motif; (ch 3, sl st in next loop on First Motif; ch 3, sc in next sc on Second Motif; ch 3, sl st in next loop on First Motif; ch 3, skip next sp on Second Motif; cluster over next 3 sts on Second Motif) twice; (ch 2, sl st in next loop on First Motif; ch 2, sc in next 3 dtr on Second Motif) twice; ch 3, sc in next corner loop on Second Motif; ch 2, sl st in next corner loop on First Motif; ch 2, sc in same corner loop on Second Motif; working on Second Motif only ch 3, (sc in next 3 dtr, ch 5) twice; skip next sp, cluster over next 3 sts; starting at * on 15th rnd of First Motif, complete Second Motif exactly as for First Motif (no more joinings).
