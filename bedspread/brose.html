<br><b>3rd rnd:</b> In each ch-5 loop make: 1 sc, 1 half dc, 5 dc, 1 half dc, 1 sc (6 petals).
<br><b>4th rnd:</b> Sl st in each st to center sc under 1st loop, * ch 5, sc in center sc under next loop. Repeat from * around, ending with sl st at base of ch-5 first made.
<br><b>5th rnd:</b> In each ch-5 loop make: 1 sc, 1 half dc, 1 dc, 5 tr, 1 dc, 1 half dc, 1 sc.
<br><b>6th rnd:</b> * Ch 7, skip 1 petal, sc in back of next sc of previous loop row. Repeat from * around.

<br><b>12th rnd:</b> Sl st in each st to center dc of next shell, ** ch 5; in the sc between shells make: tr, ch 5, tr; ch 5, sc in center dc of next shell, * ch 5, sc, ch 3, sc in next loop. Repeat from * 2 more times, ch 5, sc in center dc of next shell. Repeat from ** around.
<br><b>l3th rnd:</b> ** In each of next 3 loops make a shell as before; sc in next loop, ch 3, sc in same loop, * ch 5, sc, ch 3, sc in next loop. Repeat from * 2 more times. Then repeat from ** around.
