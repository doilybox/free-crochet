<br><b>1st Row:</b> Ch 5, join to form a ring,  sc in ring, * ch 4,  sc in ring, repeat from* 6 times, ch 1, dc in 1st  sc (this brings thread in position for next row.) 
 <br><b>2nd Row:</b> Ch 7, * thread over needle twice, insert in 5th st from hook, pull through and work off 2 loops twice, repeat from * once, thread over and pull through all loops on needle at one time, * dc in next loop, cluster st in top of dc just made, (cluster st: ch 4, this counts as 1 trc, thread over twice, insert in st, pull through and work off 2 loops twice, thread over twice, insert in same space, pull through and work off 2 loops twice, thread over and pull through all loops at one time) repeat from * all around, join at base of 1st cluster st. 
 <br><b>3rd Row:</b> Cluster st in same space, ch 3, 3 trc cluster st in same space, * ch 9,  sc in dc between next 2 cluster sts, ch 9, 2-3 trc cluster sts in dc between next 2 cluster sts with ch 3 between, repeat from * twice, ch 9,  sc in &nbsp;dc between next 2 cluster sts, ch 9, join in top of 1st cluster st. 
<br><b>4th Row:</b> Sl st to center st of ch 3 loop,  sc in same space, * ch 9, sc in next loop, cluster st in  sc just made, cluster st in top of cluster st just made,  sc in next loop, ch 9,  sc in next ch 3 loop, repeat from * twice, ch 9,  sc in next loop, cluster st in  sc just made, cluster st in cluster st,  sc in next loop, ch 5, d trc (3 times over needle) in 1st  sc. 
<br><b>5th Row:</b> Ch 7, 2 d trc with ch 9 between in same space as d trc just made, * ch 7,  sc in next loop, ch 7,  sc between next 2 cluster sts, ch 7,  sc in next loop, ch 7, 2 d trc with ch 9 between in next  sc, repeat from * twice, ch 7,  sc in next loop, ch 7,  sc between next 2 cluster sts, ch 7, sl st in 1st d trc, break thread. 
<br><b>Work another motif in same manner joining to 1st motif in last row as follows:</b> ch 7, dtrc in same space as d trc just made, ch 4, sl st in center st of corner loop of 1st motif, ch 4, d trc in same space with last d tr c of 2nd motif, ch 3, join to center st of next loop of 1st motif, ch 3,  sc in next loop of 2nd motif, ch 3, join to center st of next loop of 1st motif, ch 3,  sc between next 2 cluster sts of 2nd motif, ch 3, join to center st of next loop of 1st motif, ch 3,  sc in next loop of 2nd motif, ch 3, join to center st of next loop of 1st motif, ch 3, d trc in next sc of 2nd motif, ch 4, join to center st of corner loop of 1st motif, ch 4, complete motif in same manner as 1st motif. Join 3rd motif to 2nd motif and
4th motif to 1st and 3rd motifs in same manner. 
<br><b>RUFFLE:</b> Attach thread in any corner loop,  sc in same space, * ch 10,  sc in same loop, repeat from * 5 times, * ch 10,  sc in next loop, ch 10,  sc in same loop, ch 10,  sc in same loop, repeat from * across side to next corner, ch 10,  sc in corner loop, * ch 10,  sc in same loop, repeat from * 5 times, continue all around in same manner working other cornerssame as last corner ending row with ch 5, tr trc (4 times over needle) in 1st  sc, this brings thread in  position for next row. 
<br><b>Next 2 Rows:</b> Ch 10,  sc in next loop, repeat from beginning all around ending each row with ch 5, tr trc in tr trc. 
<br><b>4th Row:</b> Sc in same space, ** cluster st in  sc just made, cluster st in top of cluster st just made,  sc in next loop, * ch 10,  sc in next loop, repeat from * twice, repeat from ** all around ending row with ch 5, tr trc in tr trc.
