<br><b>3rd rnd:</b> Ch 1, in each sp around make sc, hdc, dc, hdc and sc (shell made). Join to first sc. 
<br><b>4th rnd:</b> Sl st in next hdc (shell in next dc, ch 2) 12 times. Join as before. 
<br><b>5th rnd:</b> Sl st in next hdc, (shell in next dc, ch 3, skip next sp) 12 times. Join. <br><b>Next rnd:</b> Work as for 5th rnd, making 1 ch more between shells. 
<br><b>7th rnd:</b> Sl st in next hdc, * shell in next dc, ch 3, sc in next sp, ch 3. Repeat from * around. Join. 
<br><b>8th rnd:</b> Sl st in next hdc, * shell in next dc, ch 3, in next sc make tr, ch 2 and tr (tr-V st made), ch 3. Repeat from * around. Join. 
<br><b>9th rnd:</b> Sl st in each st across to next V-st sp, ch 5, dc in same sp, * ch 15, dc-V st in next V-st sp, making dc's instead of tr's (V st over V st made); ch 15. Repeat from * around. Join to 3rd ch of ch-5. 
<br><b>10th rnd:</b> In V-st sp make sl st, ch 5 and dc, * 13 dc in next loop, dc-V st over next V st. Repeat from * around, ending with 13 dc in last loop. Join as on 9th rnd 
<br>(12 scallops started).

<br><b>12th rnd:</b> Ch 4, hdc in joining (starting hdc-V st made), skip next ch-2 sp, 3 dc in each ch-5 loop across next scallop, skip next ch-2 sp, hdc-V st in next sc. Repeat from * around, ending with 3 dc in last ch-5 loop. Join to 2nd ch of ch 4. 
<br><b>13th rnd:</b> Ch 1, * sc in V st, ch 2, skip next 2 dc, sc in next dc, (ch 5, skip next dc, sc in next dc) 5 times; ch 2. Repeat from * around. Join to first sc.
