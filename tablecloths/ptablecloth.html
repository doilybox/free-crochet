<br><b>FIRST MOTIF</b> Starting at cen­ter, ch 10. Join with sl st to form ring. 1st rnd: Ch 3, 23 dc in ring. Sl st in 3rd ch of ch-3. 
<br><b>2nd rnd:</b> Ch 6, * skip 1 dc, dc in next dc, ch 3. Repeat from * around. Sl st in 3rd ch of ch-6 (12 sps). 
<br><b>3rd rnd:</b> Sl st in next ch, sc in sp, (ch 7, sc in next sp) 11 times; ch 3, tr in 1st sc. 
<br><b>4th rnd:</b> Sc in loop just made, * ch 7, sc in next loop, ch 2, 12 tr in next loop, ch 2, sc in next loop. Repeat from * around. Join. 
<br><b>5th rnd:</b> Sl st in next 2 ch of ch-7 loop, ch 3, in same loop make dc, ch 2 and 2 dc (shell made), * (tr in next tr, ch 1) 11 times; tr in next tr, in next ch-7 loop make 2 dc, ch 2 and 2 dc (another shell made). Repeat from * around. Join. 
<br><b>6th rnd:</b> Sl st in next dc and in sp, ch 3, in same sp make dc, (ch 2, 2 dc) twice; * ch 4, sc in next ch-1 sp, (ch 3, sc in next sp) 10 times; ch 4, in sp of next shell make (2 dc, ch 2) twice and 2 dc. Repeat from * around. Join. 
<br><b>7th rnd:</b> Sl st in next dc and in sp, ch 3, in same sp make dc, ch 2 and 2 dc; shell in next sp, * ch 4, sc in next ch-3 loop, (ch 3, sc in next loop) 9 times; ch 4, shell in next two ch-2 sps. Repeat from * around. Join.
<br><b>FIRST PINEAPPLE</b>
<br><b>1st row:</b> Sl st across to sp of 2nd shell, ch 3, in same sp make dc, ch 2 and 2 dc; ch 4, sc in next ch-3 loop, (ch 3, sc in next loop) 8 times; ch 4, shell over shell. Ch 5, turn. 2nd row: Shell over shell, ch 4, sc in next ch-3 loop, (ch 3, sc in next loop) 7 times; ch 4, shell over shell. Ch 5, turn.
   Work in this manner, having 1 ch-3 loop less on each row until 1 loop re­mains. Ch 5, turn. Next row: Shell over shell, ch 4, sc in ch-3 loop, ch 4, 2 dc in next shell, ch 1, sl st in sp of last shell, ch 1, 2 dc in same place as last 2 dc. Break off.

   Make 12 rows of 15 motifs, joining adjacent sides as Second Motif was joined to First Motif — but do not work the last rnd on the outside edge of outer motifs.</td></tr>
