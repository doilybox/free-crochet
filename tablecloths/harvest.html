Tablecloth measures 63 x 83 inches. Each motif measures 4 1/4 inches square.
<br><b>FIRST MOTIF</b> . . . Starting at center, ch 6. Join with sl st to form ring. 
<br><b> 1st rnd:</b> Ch 3, 23 dc in ring. Join to top of ch-3. 
<br><b> 2nd rnd:</b> Ch 6, dc in joining (corner sp); * ch 3, skip next 2 dc, dc in next dc, ch 3, skip next 2 dc, in next dc make dc, ch 3 and dc (another corner sp). Repeat from * around, ending with ch 3. Join to 3rd ch of ch-6. 
<br><b> 3rd rnd:</b> Ch 4, in corner sp make 4 tr, ch 3 and 5 tr; * ch 2, skip next sp, in next dc make dc, ch 3 and dc; ch 2, in corner sp make 5 tr, ch 3 and 5 tr. Repeat from * around, ending with ch 2. Join to top of ch-4. 
<br><b> 4th rnd:</b> Ch 5, holding back on hook the last loop of each d tr, d tr in next 4 tr, thread over and draw through all loops on hook (cluster made); * ch 3, in next sp make (5 d tr, ch 3) twice; 5-d tr cluster over next 5 tr, ch 3, skip next sp, in next sp make (tr, ch 3) twice; cluster over next 5 tr. Repeat from * around, ending with ch 3. Join to tip of first cluster. 
<br><b> 5th rnd:</b> Sl st to within next d tr, ch 5, cluster over next 4 d tr, * ch 3, in next sp make (5 d tr, ch 3) twice; cluster over next 5 d tr; ch 3, skip next 2 sps, in next sp make (tr, ch 3) 4 times; skip next 2 sps, cluster over next 5 d tr. Repeat from * around, ending with ch 3. Join. 
<br><b> 6th rnd:</b> Sl st to within next d tr, ch 5, cluster over next 4 d tr, * ch 3, in next sp make (5 d tr, ch 3) twice; cluster over next 5 d tr, ch 3, skip next 2 sps, in each of next 3 sps make (tr, ch 3) twice; skip next 2 sps, cluster over next 5 d tr. Repeat from * around, ending as before. Join. 
<br><b>7th rnd:</b> Sl st to within next d tr, ch 5, cluster over next 4 d tr, * ch 3, 5 d tr in next sp, ch 3, cluster over next 5 d tr, ch 3, skip next 2 sps, in each of next 5 sps make (tr, ch 3) twice; skip next 2 sps, cluster over next 5 d tr. Repeat from * around, ending as before. Join. 
<br><b>8th rnd:</b> Sc in joining, * ch 9, cluster over next 5 d tr, ch 5, sc in tip of cluster just made, ch 9, sc in tip of next cluster, ch 7, skip next sp, sc in next sp, ch 5, sc in next sp, (ch 3, sc in next sp) 6 times; ch 5, sc in next sp, ch 7, sc in tip of next cluster. Repeat from * around, ending with ch 7. Join to first sc. Break off and fasten. 
<br><b>SECOND MOTIF</b> . . . Work as for First Motif until 7 rnds have been completed. 
<br><b>8th rnd:</b> Sc in joining ch 9, cluster over next 5 d tr, now join the side of 2 motifs together as follows: ch 2, sl st in corner loop on First Motif; ch 2, sc in tip of cluster just made on Second Motif; ch 4, sl st in next loop on First Motif; ch 4, sc in tip of next cluster on Second Motif; ch 3, sl st in next loop on First Motif; ch 3, skip next sp on Second Motif, sc in next sp on Second Motif; ch 2, sl st in next loop on First Motif; ch 2, sc in next sp on Second Motif; (ch 1, sl st in next loop on First Motif; ch 1, sc in next sp on Second Motif) 6 times; ch 2, sl st in next loop on First Motif; ch 2, sc in next sp on Second Motif; ch 3, sl st in next loop on First Motif; ch 3, sc in tip of next cluster on Second Motif; ch 4, sl st in next loop on First Motif; ch 4, cluster over next 5 d tr on Second Motif; ch 2, sl st in corner loop on First Motif; ch 2, sc in tip of cluster just made on Second Motif (the side of 2 motifs now joined together); now starting at t on 8th rnd of First Motif, complete motif exactly as for First Motif (no more joinings). Make 14 x 19 Motifs, joining motifs as Second Motif was joined to First Motif (where corners meet, join to previous joinings). 
<br><b>EDGING</b>
<br><b>1st rnd:</b> Attach thread to any corner ch-5 loop, ** sc in corner ch-5 loop, * (ch 7, sc in next loop) twice; (ch 5, sc in next loop) 9 times; ch 7, sc in next loop, ch 7, sc in joining between motifs. Repeat from * across to within next corner loop, ending with ch 7. Repeat from ** around, ending with ch 2, d tr in first sc to form last loop. 
<br><b>2nd rnd:</b> In loop just formed make (sc, ch 7) twice; ** in first loop on next side make sc, ch 7 and sc; * ch 5, sc in next loop. Repeat from * across side, ending with (sc, ch 7) twice in last loop. Repeat from ** around, ending with ch 2, dc in first sc to form last loop. 3rd rnd: Sc in loop just formed, ch 5, sc in next loop, ** ch 7, in corner loop make (sc, ch 7) twice; sc in next loop, * ch 5, sc in next loop. Repeat from * across side to within next corner loop. Repeat from ** around, forming last loop as on 2nd rnd. 4th rnd: Sc in loop just formed, * ch 7, dc in 5th ch from hook, ch 2, sc in next loop.
