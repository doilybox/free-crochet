<br><b>Starting</b> at center, ch 18. Join with sl st to form ring. 
<br><b>1st rnd:</b> Ch 4, holding back on hook the last loop of each tr, make 2 tr in ring, thread over and draw through all loops on hook-starting cluster made; (ch 5, holding back on hook the last loop of each tr, make 3 tr in ring, thread over and draw through all loops on hook-cluster made) 11 times; ch 2, dc in tip of first cluster to form last loop. 
<br><b>2nd rnd:</b> Ch 1, sc in loop just formed, * ch 12, sc in next loop, (ch 4, sc in next loop) twice. Repeat from * around, ending with ch 12, sc in next loop, ch 4, sc in next loop, tr in first sc. 
<br><b>3rd rnd:</b> * In next ch-12 loop make (cluster, ch 5) 7 times and cluster; skip next ch-4 loop, sc in next sc. Repeat from * around, ending with skip last ch-4 loop, join to tip of first cluster. 
<br><b>4th rnd:</b> Sl st to center of second ch-5 loop, ch 1, sc in same loop, * ch 12, sc in next loop, (ch 4, sc in next loop) twice; ch 12, sc in next loop, ch 9, skip next two loops, sc in next loop. Repeat from * around, ending with ch 4, dtr in first sc to form last ch-9 loop. 
<br><b>5th rnd:</b> Ch 1, sc in loop just formed, * in next ch-12 loop make (cluster, ch 5) 7 times and cluster; skip next ch-4 loop, sc in next sc, in next ch-12 loop make (cluster, ch 5) 7 times and cluster; sc in next ch-9 loop. Repeat from * around, joining last cluster to first sc. 
<br><b>6th rnd:</b> Sl st to center of second ch-5 loop, ch 1, sc in same loop, * (ch 9, skip next loop, sc in next loop) twice; ch 9, skip next 2 loops, sc in next loop. Repeat from * around, ending with ch 4, dtr in first sc-24 loops. 
<br><b>7th rnd:</b> Ch 1, sc in loop just formed, * ch 10, sc in next loop. Repeat from * around, ending with ch 5, dtr in first sc. 
<br><b>8th rnd:</b> Ch 1, sc in loop just formed, * ch 11, sc in next loop. Repeat from * around, ending with ch 6, dtr in first sc. 
<br><b>9th rnd:</b> Ch 1, sc in loop just formed, * ch 12, sc in next loop. Repeat from * around, ending with ch 12. Join to first sc. 
<br><b>10th rnd:</b> Ch 1, sc in joining, 15 sc in next loop, * sc in next sc, 15 sc in next loop. Repeat from * around. Join. 
<br><b>11 th rnd:</b> Skip joining, sl st in next 5 sc, * sc in next sc, ch 5, skip 3 sc, sc in next sc, ch 12, skip 11 sc. Repeat from * around. Join to first sc. 
<br><b>12th rnd:</b> Sl st to center of first ch-5 loop, sc in same loop, * holding back on hook the last loop of each dc, make 3 dc in next ch-12 loop, thread over and draw through all loops on hook-3-dc cluster made; ch 5, in same loop make (3-tr cluster, ch 5) 6 times and 3-dc cluster; sc in next ch-5 loop. Repeat from * around, ending with a 3-dc cluster. Join to first sc. <br><b>13th rnd:</b> Sl st to center of third ch-5 loop, sc in same loop, * ch 7, skip next loop, sc in next loop, ch 9, skip next 4 loops, sc in next loop. Repeat from * around, ending as on 6th rnd. 
<br><b>14th rnd:</b> Ch 1, sc in loop just formed, * ch 9, sc in next loop. Repeat from * around, ending as on 6th rnd. 
<br><b>15th rnd:</b> Ch 1, sc in loop just formed, * ch 12, sc in next loop, ch 7, sc in next loop. Repeat from * around, ending with ch 3, tr in first sc. 
<br><b>16th rnd:</b> Ch 1, sc in loop just formed, * in next loop make (3-tr cluster, ch 5) 7 times and 3-tr cluster; sc in next loop. Repeat from * around, joining last 3-tr cluster to first sc. <br><b>17th rnd:</b> Sl st to center of third ch-5 loop, sc in same loop, * (ch 5, sc in next loop) twice; ch 14, skip next 4 loops, sc in next loop. Repeat from * around, ending with ch 14. Join to first sc. 
<br><b>18th rnd:</b> Sl st to center of first ch-5 loop, draw up a loop in same ch-5 loop and next ch-5 loop, thread over and draw through all 3 loops on hook-group st made; * in next ch-14 loop make (3-tr cluster, ch 5) 7 times and 3-tr cluster; draw up a loop in each of next two ch-5 loops, thread over and draw through all 3 loops on hook-group st made. Repeat from * around, joining last 3-tr cluster to first group st. 
<br><b>19th rnd:</b> Sl st to center of second loop, sc in same loop, * (ch 7, skip next loop, sc in next loop) twice; ch 9, skip next 2 loops, sc in next loop. Repeat from * around, ending as on 6th rnd. 
<br><b>20th and 21st rnds:</b> Repeat 14th and 7th rnds. 
<br><b>22nd rnd:</b> 5 sc in loop just formed, * sc in next sc, 10 sc in next loop. Repeat from * around, ending with 5 sc in last loop. Join. Break off and fasten. Starch lightly and press.
