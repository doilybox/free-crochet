<br><b>Starting at center:</b> Ch 20. Join with sl st to form ring. 
<br><b>1st rnd:</b> Ch 1, make 36 sc in ring. Join to first sc. 
<br><b>2nd rnd:</b> Make a starting long-tr cluster over joining and next sc-to make a starting long-tr cluster: ch 7, holding back on hook the last loop of each long tr, thread over hook 5 times, insert hook in joining and draw a loop through-7 loops on hook, (thread over and draw through 2 loops on hook) 5 times; make 2 long tr in next sc, thread over and draw through remaining 4 loops on hook; ch 9, skip next sc, * make a 4-long-tr cluster, having 2 long tr in each of next 2 sc, ch 9, skip next sc. Repeat from * around. Join to tip of first cluster. 
<br><b>3rd rnd:</b> Ch 3, in joining make dc, ch 2 and 2 dc-starting shell made; ch 3, sc in next loop, ch 3-lacet made; * in tip of next cluster make 2 dc, ch 2 and 2 dc-shell made; ch 3, sc in next loop, ch 3. Repeat from * around. Join to top of ch-3. 
<br><b>4th rnd:</b> Sl st in first dc and in ch-2 sp, make starting shell in same sp-shell over shell made; ch 9, skip next lacet, * shell in next shell sp-another shell over shell made; ch 9, skip next lacet. Repeat from * around. Join as before. 
<br><b>5th rnd:</b> * Shell over shell, ch 5, sc in next loop, ch 5. Repeat from * around. Join. 
<br><b>6th rnd:</b> * Shell over shell, ch 11. Repeat from * around. Join. 
<br><b>7th rnd:</b> Sl st in first dc and in next ch-2 sp, ch 3, in same sp make dc, ch 4 and 2 dc; ch 6, sc in next loop, ch 6, * in next ch-2 sp make 2 dc, ch 4 and 2 dc, ch 6, sc in next loop, ch 6. Repeat from * around. Join. 
<br><b>8th rnd:</b> Sl st in first dc and in ch-4 sp, in same sp make a starting long-tr cluster, (ch 7, long-tr cluster) 3 times; * in next ch-4 sp make (long-tr cluster, ch 7) 3 times and long-tr cluster. Repeat from * around. Join to tip of first cluster. 
<br><b>9th rnd:</b> Sl st in next 2 ch, sc in loop, ch 5, sc in same loop, * ch 7, sc in next loop, (ch 7, in next loop make sc, ch 5 and sc) twice. Repeat from * around to within last 2 loops, ch 7, sc in next loop, ch 7, in next loop make sc, ch 5 and sc; ch 3, tr in first sc to form last loop. 
<br><b>10th rnd:</b> Shell in loop just formed, * ch 3, (sc in next loop, ch 7) 3 times; sc in next loop, ch 3, shell in next loop. Repeat from * around, ending with ch 3. Join. 
<br><b>11th rnd:</b> * Shell over shell, ch 5, sc in next ch-7 loop, ch 5, shell in next loop, ch 5, sc in next loop, ch 5. Repeat from * around. Join. 
<br><b>12th rnd:</b> Repeat 6th rnd. 
<br><b>13th rnd:</b> (Shell over shell, ch 3, in next loop make sc, ch 7 and sc; ch 3) 24 times. Join. 
<br><b>14th rnd:</b> (Shell over shell, ch 5, sc in next ch-7 loop, ch 5) 24 times. Join. 
<br><b>15th rnd:</b> * Shell over shell, ch 2, 2 dc in same shell sp, ch 3, sc in next loop, ch 5, sc in next loop, ch 3, shell over shell, ch 3, sc in next loop, ch 5, sc in next loop, ch 3. Repeat from * around. Join. 
<br><b>16th rnd:</b> Shell over shell, ch 1, * shell in next ch-2 sp, (ch 5, sc in next ch-5 loop, ch 5, shell over shell) twice; ch 1. Repeat from * around, ending with shell over last shell, ch 5, sc in next ch-5 loop, ch 5. Join. 
<br><b>17th rnd:</b> * Shell over shell, ch 3, (shell over shell, ch 11) twice. Repeat from * around. Join.
